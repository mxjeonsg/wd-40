## WD-40 Bot

# Why to choose WD-40 Bot over another bots?
Easy, this bot has the tastiest touch of Face's Attic(R)(TM) hobby: <strong>Gambling</strong>.
Even though Gambling per sé is bad, this isn't.

The key feature of WD-40 Bot is it's automod mechanisms: Gamification.
Getting softbanned (temporarily banned), timeouted, or hardbanned (permanently banned)
is already a funshow for the other members of the server that happen to be active and
inside the channel, so you're already getting humilliated, but, why not potentiate it[¹]?

Your punishment could be randomised at first if configured, or gamificated, giving the
expectators a chance on deciding which your punishment will be, or the time you'll be punished,
some nice North Korean democracy(R)[² ³].

[¹] Take this statement not to heart, it's a way to humorise getting punished through Discord.
    This project and the developer do NOT condone, promote or solidify behaviours such as moderation
    team abuse, high rank staff abuse, bullying or toxic behaviours derivated from minimising
    anyone's feelings. This is founded from joking, laughing, and humour in any essence.[⁴]

[²] This is NOT a political statement in any manner. Again, this is just a joke based in a
    country's political status, this project and the developer do NOT condone, promote, incentivise
    nor solidify Capitalism, Communism, Socialism, Dictatorship(s) nor genocidium. This project is not
    based in a political, religious or any other ideology(ies) more then satire and humour.

[³] Even though ripping off the mentioned feature would make this project lose it's flavour,
    measures to avoid exploitation in bad faith will be implemented in further updates
    so this codebase and idea is not used to perpetuate any kind of bullying or psychological abuse.

[⁴] A COC(K) (Code of Conduct) will be created so, inside the file, the faith and scope of this project
    can be clarified, to further explain the boundaries I (the developer) wish aren't surpassed while
    using this project logic, code or mechanisms. Plus, any kind of medium of contact will be facilitated
    for everyone who feels this project is being used in bad faith against.

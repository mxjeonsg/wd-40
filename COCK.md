## Thought behind (TBFE)
In essence, this project has the thought of making moderation tasks funnier for the moderation
team in charge, and more importantly the common guild member that happens to be around watching.

Talking about "Making moderation tasks funnier" addresses gamifying in a "gambling" and/or "voting"
fashion. The project pretend to establish gamifying mechanisms to promote guild's dynamism, guild's
voting option, and to spread a more funnier feeling of joy when moderation is being enforced.

Nevertheless, this doesn't pretend to demure the seriousness of consequences regarding member's unfaithful proceed,
the aim belongs to just make the guild's atmosphere more soothing and less awkward during and after moderation
is aplied. To reinforce this statements, an umbral of gamification will be applied, so certain parts of the mechanism(s)
can be changed, adapted or disabled according to the guild's values, rules, and staff's values.

## Avoid Misuse of the project (TBFE)
Plus, the fact of staff misbehave towards guild members can't be disregarded as well, so, some measures will be applied in the
common member's end to avoid some traits of misuse, or to dissolve some of the "acid humour" on the automod gamifying features so
the user don't get overwhelmed by this project nature.
In order to achieve this facility, some settings can be configured by the user (and not by guild administration/moderation staff)
so the user can be okay with the automod gamified mechanisms.

## Further expansion of this document will be done in next commits.
